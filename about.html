        <p>
          <strong>Coding with Digital Experience</strong> is a vibrant Code Club initiative, founded at the African Leadership University (ALU), dedicated to empowering high school students across Rwanda. Our club is built on the belief that digital literacy and hands-on coding experience are essential skills for today’s youth. By providing a collaborative and inclusive environment, we aim to inspire young minds to confidently embrace technology, develop essential coding skills, and pursue advanced careers in tech.
